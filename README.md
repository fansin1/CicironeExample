CiceroneDaggerDemo

This is a demo Android project showing how to use Cicerone and Dagger2 to build an instagram-like flow (an app with a BottomNavigation bar that stays visible as the user navigates, preserving the backstack of each tab individually).
This type of flow is particularly tricky to implement on Android, so these libraries take away a bit of the pain.
